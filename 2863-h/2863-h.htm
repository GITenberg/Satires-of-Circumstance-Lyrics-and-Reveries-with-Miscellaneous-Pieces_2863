AND REVERIES</h2>
<h3><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>IN FRONT
OF THE LANDSCAPE</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Plunging</span> and
labouring on in a tide of visions,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dolorous and dear,<br />
Forward I pushed my way as amid waste waters<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Stretching around,<br />
Through whose eddies there glimmered the customed landscape<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yonder and near,</p>
<p class="poetry">Blotted to feeble mist.&nbsp; And the coomb and
the upland<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Foliage-crowned,<br />
Ancient chalk-pit, milestone, rills in the grass-flat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Stroked by the light,<br />
Seemed but a ghost-like gauze, and no substantial<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Meadow or mound.</p>
<p class="poetry">What were the infinite spectacles bulking
foremost<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Under my sight,<br />
<a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>Hindering me
to discern my paced advancement<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lengthening to miles;<br />
What were the re-creations killing the daytime<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As by the night?</p>
<p class="poetry">O they were speechful faces, gazing
insistent,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some as with smiles,<br />
Some as with slow-born tears that brinily trundled<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the wrecked<br />
Cheeks that were fair in their flush-time, ash now with
anguish,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Harrowed by wiles.</p>
<p class="poetry">Yes, I could see them, feel them, hear them,
address them&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Halo-bedecked&mdash;<br />
And, alas, onwards, shaken by fierce unreason,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rigid in hate,<br />
Smitten by years-long wryness born of misprision,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dreaded, suspect.</p>
<p class="poetry">Then there would breast me shining sights,
sweet seasons<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Further in date;<br />
Instruments of strings with the tenderest passion<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Vibrant, beside<br />
<a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>Lamps long
extinguished, robes, cheeks, eyes with the earth&rsquo;s crust<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Now corporate.</p>
<p class="poetry">Also there rose a headland of hoary aspect<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Gnawed by the tide,<br />
Frilled by the nimb of the morning as two friends stood there<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Guilelessly glad&mdash;<br />
Wherefore they knew not&mdash;touched by the fringe of an
ecstasy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Scantly descried.</p>
<p class="poetry">Later images too did the day unfurl me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shadowed and sad,<br />
Clay cadavers of those who had shared in the dramas,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Laid now at ease,<br />
Passions all spent, chiefest the one of the broad brow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sepulture-clad.</p>
<p class="poetry">So did beset me scenes miscalled of the
bygone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the leaze,<br />
Past the clump, and down to where lay the beheld ones;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &mdash;Yea, as the rhyme<br />
Sung by the sea-swell, so in their pleading dumbness<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Captured me these.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>For, their lost revisiting manifestations<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In their own time<br />
Much had I slighted, caring not for their purport,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing behind<br />
Things more coveted, reckoned the better worth calling<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweet, sad, sublime.</p>
<p class="poetry">Thus do they now show hourly before the
intenser<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Stare of the mind<br />
As they were ghosts avenging their slights by my bypast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Body-borne eyes,<br />
Show, too, with fuller translation than rested upon them<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As living kind.</p>
<p class="poetry">Hence wag the tongues of the passing people,
saying<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In their surmise,<br />
&ldquo;Ah&mdash;whose is this dull form that perambulates, seeing
nought<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Round him that looms<br />
Whithersoever his footsteps turn in his farings,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Save a few tombs?&rdquo;</p>

FIRING</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">That</span> night your
great guns, unawares,<br />
Shook all our coffins as we lay,<br />
And broke the chancel window-squares,<br />
We thought it was the Judgment-day</p>
<p class="poetry">And sat upright.&nbsp; While drearisome<br />
Arose the howl of wakened hounds:<br />
The mouse let fall the altar-crumb,<br />
The worms drew back into the mounds,</p>
<p class="poetry">The glebe cow drooled.&nbsp; Till God called,
&ldquo;No;<br />
It&rsquo;s gunnery practice out at sea<br />
Just as before you went below;<br />
The world is as it used to be:</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;All nations striving strong to make<br
/>
Red war yet redder.&nbsp; Mad as hatters<br />
They do no more for Christ&eacute;s sake<br />
Than you who are helpless in such matters.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>&ldquo;That this is not the judgment-hour<br />
For some of them&rsquo;s a blessed thing,<br />
For if it were they&rsquo;d have to scour<br />
Hell&rsquo;s floor for so much threatening . . .</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Ha, ha.&nbsp; It will be warmer when<br
/>
I blow the trumpet (if indeed<br />
I ever do; for you are men,<br />
And rest eternal sorely need).&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">So down we lay again.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wonder,<br
/>
Will the world ever saner be,&rdquo;<br />
Said one, &ldquo;than when He sent us under<br />
In our indifferent century!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">And many a skeleton shook his head.<br />
&ldquo;Instead of preaching forty year,&rdquo;<br />
My neighbour Parson Thirdly said,<br />
&ldquo;I wish I had stuck to pipes and beer.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Again the guns disturbed the hour,<br />
Roaring their readiness to avenge,<br />
As far inland as Stourton Tower,<br />
And Camelot, and starlit Stonehenge.</p>

the Past and I,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Past and I;<br />
I tended while it hovered nigh,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Leaving me never alone.<br />
It was a spectral housekeeping<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where fell no jarring tone,<br />
As strange, as still a housekeeping<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As ever has been known.</p>
<p class="poetry">As daily I went up the stair<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And down the stair,<br />
I did not mind the Bygone there&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Present once to me;<br />
Its moving meek companionship<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I wished might ever be,<br />
There was in that companionship<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Something of ecstasy.</p>
<p class="poetry">It dwelt with me just as it was,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Just as it was<br />
When first its prospects gave me pause<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In wayward wanderings,<br />
<a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>Before the
years had torn old troths<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As they tear all sweet things,<br />
Before gaunt griefs had torn old troths<br />

<p class="poetry">And then its form began to fade,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Began to fade,<br />
Its gentle echoes faintlier played<br />

Than when the autumn&rsquo;s look embrowned<br />

The autumn&rsquo;s settling shades embrowned<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nooks that it haunted near.</p>
<p class="poetry">And so with time my vision less,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yea, less and less<br />
Makes of that Past my housemistress,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It dwindles in my eye;<br />
It looms a far-off skeleton<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And not a comrade nigh,<br />
A fitful far-off skeleton<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dimming as days draw by.</p>
<h3><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>AFTER
THE VISIT<br />
(<i>To F. E. D.</i>)</h3>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span

Where your presence was as a leaf that skims<br />
Down a drouthy way whose ascent bedims<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The bloom on the farer&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come again, with the feet<br
/>
That were light on the green as a thistledown ball,<br />
And those mute ministrations to one and to all<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond a man&rsquo;s saying sweet.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until then the faint scent<br
/>
Of the bordering flowers swam unheeded away,<br />
And I marked not the charm in the changes of day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As the cloud-colours came and went.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the dark corridors<br
/>
Your walk was so soundless I did not know<br />
Your form from a phantom&rsquo;s of long ago<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Said to pass on the ancient floors,</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>Till you drew from the shade,<br />
And I saw the large luminous living eyes<br />
Regard me in fixed inquiring-wise<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As those of a soul that weighed,</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarce consciously,<br />
The eternal question of what Life was,<br />
And why we were there, and by whose strange laws<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That which mattered most could not be.</p>

MEET, OR OTHERWISE</h3>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Whether</span> to sally and
see thee, girl of my dreams,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or whether to stay<br />
And see thee not!&nbsp; How vast the difference seems<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Yea from Nay<br />
Just now.&nbsp; Yet this same sun will slant its beams<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At no far day<br />
On our two mounds, and then what will the difference weigh!</p>
<p class="poetry">Yet I will see thee, maiden dear, and make<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The most I can<br />
Of what remains to us amid this brake Cimmerian<br />
Through which we grope, and from whose thorns we ache,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While still we scan<br />
Round our frail faltering progress for some path or plan.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

&nbsp;&nbsp; It will have been:<br />
Nor God nor Daemon can undo the done,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unsight the seen,<br />
Make muted music be as unbegun,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though things terrene<br />
Groan in their bondage till oblivion supervene.</p>
<p class="poetry">So, to the one long-sweeping symphony<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From times remote<br />
Till now, of human tenderness, shall we<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Supply one note,<br />
Small and untraced, yet that will ever be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Somewhere afloat<br />
Amid the spheres, as part of sick Life&rsquo;s antidote.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">II</p>

HEIGHTS (1896)</h2>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">There</span> are some
heights in Wessex, shaped as if by a kindly hand<br />
For thinking, dreaming, dying on, and at crises when I stand,<br
/>
Say, on Ingpen Beacon eastward, or on Wylls-Neck westwardly,<br
/>
I seem where I was before my birth, and after death may be.</p>
<p class="poetry">In the lowlands I have no comrade, not even the
lone man&rsquo;s friend&mdash;<br />
Her who suffereth long and is kind; accepts what he is too weak
to mend:<br />
Down there they are dubious and askance; there nobody thinks as
I,<br />
But mind-chains do not clank where one&rsquo;s next neighbour is
the sky.</p>
<p class="poetry">In the towns I am tracked by phantoms having
weird detective ways&mdash;<br />
Shadows of beings who fellowed with myself of earlier days:<br />
<a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>They hang
about at places, and they say harsh heavy things&mdash;<br />
Men with a frigid sneer, and women with tart disparagings.</p>
<p class="poetry">Down there I seem to be false to myself, my
simple self that was,<br />
And is not now, and I see him watching, wondering what crass
cause<br />
Can have merged him into such a strange continuator as this,<br
/>
Who yet has something in common with himself, my chrysalis.</p>
<p class="poetry">I cannot go to the great grey Plain;
there&rsquo;s a figure against the moon,<br />
Nobody sees it but I, and it makes my breast beat out of tune;<br
/>
I cannot go to the tall-spired town, being barred by the forms
now passed<br />
For everybody but me, in whose long vision they stand there
fast.</p>
<p class="poetry">There&rsquo;s a ghost at Yell&rsquo;ham Bottom
chiding loud at the fall of the night,<br />
There&rsquo;s a ghost in Froom-side Vale, thin lipped and vague,
in a shroud of white,<br />
There is one in the railway-train whenever I do not want it
near,<br />
I see its profile against the pane, saying what I would not
hear.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

hers,<br />
I enter her mind and another thought succeeds me that she
prefers;<br />
Yet my love for her in its fulness she herself even did not
know;<br />
Well, time cures hearts of tenderness, and now I can let her
go.</p>
<p class="poetry">So I am found on Ingpen Beacon, or on
Wylls-Neck to the west,<br />
Or else on homely Bulbarrow, or little Pilsdon Crest,<br />
Where men have never cared to haunt, nor women have walked with
me,<br />
And ghosts then keep their distance; and I know some liberty.</p>

In a basin of water, I never miss<br />
The sweet sharp sense of a fugitive day<br />
Fetched back from its thickening shroud of gray.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; And real love-rhyme<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That I know by heart,<br />

About three spans wide and two spans tall<br />
Over a table of solid rock,<br />
And into a scoop of the self-same block;<br />
The purl of a runlet that never ceases<br />
In stir of kingdoms, in wars, in peaces;<br />
With a hollow boiling voice it speaks<br />
And has spoken since hills were turfless peaks.&rdquo;</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; My lover and I<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Walked under a sky<br />
Of blue with a leaf-woven awning of green,<br />
In the burn of August, to paint the scene,<br />
And we placed our basket of fruit and wine<br />
By the runlet&rsquo;s rim, where we sat to dine;<br />
And when we had drunk from the glass together,<br />
Arched by the oak-copse from the weather,<br />
I held the vessel to rinse in the fall,<br />
Where it slipped, and sank, and was past recall,<br />
Though we stooped and plumbed the little abyss<br />
With long bared arms.&nbsp; There the glass still is.<br />
And, as said, if I thrust my arm below<br />
Cold water in basin or bowl, a throe<br />
From the past awakens a sense of that time,<br />
And the glass both used, and the cascade&rsquo;s rhyme.<br />
The basin seems the pool, and its edge<br />
The hard smooth face of the brook-side ledge,<br />
And the leafy pattern of china-ware<br />
The hanging plants that were bathing there.<br />

A footstep from the domestic groove.&rdquo;</p>

No woman ever will make herself look older than she is.&rdquo;<br

I did not answer; but I thought, &ldquo;you err there, ancient

<p class="poetry">It took a rare one, true, to do it; for she was
surely rare&mdash;<br />
As rare a soul at that sweet time of her life as she was fair.<br

And urging motives, too, were strong, for ours was a passionate
case,<br />
Yea, passionate enough to lead to freaking with that young
face.</p>
<p class="poetry">I have told no one about it, should perhaps

But I think it over now that life looms dull and years

<a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>How
blank we stood at our bright wits&rsquo; end, two frail barks in

crisis of this kind<br />
Is going it thorough!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she calmly

And we blanched her dark locks ruthlessly: set wrinkles on her
brow;<br />
Ay&mdash;she was a right rare woman then, whatever she may be
now.</p>
<p class="poetry">That night we heard a coach drive up, and
questions asked below.<br />
&ldquo;A gent with an elderly wife, sir,&rdquo; was returned from
the bureau.<br />
And the wheels went rattling on, and free at last from public
ken<br />
We washed all off in her chamber and restored her youth
again.</p>
<p class="poetry">How many years ago it was!&nbsp; Some fifty can
it be<br />
Since that adventure held us, and she played old wife to me?<br

But in time convention won her, as it wins all women at last,<br

And now she is rich and respectable, and time has buried the
past.</p>

And a new beginning, a fresh fair heaven, have smoothed the

But you were less feebly human, and no passionate need for
clinging<br />
Possessed your soul to overthrow reserve when I came near;<br />
Ay, though you suffer as much as I from storms the hours are
bringing<br />
Upon your heart and mine, I never see you shed a tear.</p>

Why did you not make war on me with those who weep like rain?<br

You felt too much, so gained no balm for all your torrid

And hence our deep division, and our dark undying pain.</p>

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">The</span> new-vamped Abbey
shaped apace<br />
In the fourteenth century of grace;</p>
<p class="poetry">(The church which, at an after date,<br />
Acquired cathedral rank and state.)</p>
<p class="poetry">Panel and circumscribing wall<br />
Of latest feature, trim and tall,</p>
<p class="poetry">Rose roundabout the Norman core<br />
In prouder pose than theretofore,</p>
<p class="poetry">Encasing magically the old<br />
With parpend ashlars manifold.</p>
<p class="poetry">The trowels rang out, and tracery<br />
Appeared where blanks had used to be.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
211</span>Men toiled for pleasure more than pay,<br />
And all went smoothly day by day,</p>
<p class="poetry">Till, in due course, the transept part<br />
Engrossed the master-mason&rsquo;s art.</p>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;Home-coming thence he tossed and
turned<br />
Throughout the night till the new sun burned.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;What fearful visions have inspired<br />
These gaingivings?&rdquo; his wife inquired;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;As if your tools were in your hand<br />
You have hammered, fitted, muttered, planned;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;You have thumped as you were working
hard:<br />
I might have found me bruised and scarred.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;What then&rsquo;s amiss.&nbsp; What
eating care<br />
Looms nigh, whereof I am unaware?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">He answered not, but churchward went,<br />
Viewing his draughts with discontent;</p>
<p class="poetry">And fumbled there the livelong day<br />
Till, hollow-eyed, he came away.</p>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;&rsquo;Twas said, &ldquo;The
master-mason&rsquo;s ill!&rdquo;<br />
And all the abbey works stood still.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>Quoth Abbot Wygmore: &ldquo;Why, O why<br />
Distress yourself?&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll surely die!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">The mason answered, trouble-torn,<br />
&ldquo;This long-vogued style is quite outworn!</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;The upper archmould nohow serves<br />
To meet the lower tracery curves:</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;The ogees bend too far away<br />
To give the flexures interplay.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;This it is causes my distress . . .<br
/>
So it will ever be unless</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;New forms be found to supersede<br />
The circle when occasions need.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;To carry it out I have tried and
toiled,<br />
And now perforce must own me foiled!</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Jeerers will say: &lsquo;Here was a
man<br />
Who could not end what he began!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;So passed that day, the next, the
next;<br />
The abbot scanned the task, perplexed;</p>
<p class="poetry">The townsmen mustered all their wit<br />
To fathom how to compass it,</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
213</span>But no raw artistries availed<br />
Where practice in the craft had failed . . .</p>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;One night he tossed, all open-eyed,<br
/>
And early left his helpmeet&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p class="poetry">Scattering the rushes of the floor<br />
He wandered from the chamber door</p>
<p class="poetry">And sought the sizing pile, whereon<br />
Struck dimly a cadaverous dawn</p>
<p class="poetry">Through freezing rain, that drenched the
board<br />
Of diagram-lines he last had scored&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">Chalked phantasies in vain begot<br />
To knife the architectural knot&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">In front of which he dully stood,<br />
Regarding them in hopeless mood.</p>
<p class="poetry">He closelier looked; then looked again:<br />
The chalk-scratched draught-board faced the rain,</p>
<p class="poetry">Whose icicled drops deformed the lines<br />
Innumerous of his lame designs,</p>
<p class="poetry">So that they streamed in small white threads<br
/>
From the upper segments to the heads</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
214</span>Of arcs below, uniting them<br />
Each by a stalactitic stem.</p>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;At once, with eyes that struck out
sparks,<br />
He adds accessory cusping-marks,</p>
<p class="poetry">Then laughs aloud.&nbsp; The thing was done<br
/>
So long assayed from sun to sun . . .</p>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;Now in his joy he grew aware<br />
Of one behind him standing there,</p>
<p class="poetry">And, turning, saw the abbot, who<br />
The weather&rsquo;s whim was watching too.</p>
<p class="poetry">Onward to Prime the abbot went,<br />
Tacit upon the incident.</p>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;Men now discerned as days revolved<br />
The ogive riddle had been solved;</p>
<p class="poetry">Templates were cut, fresh lines were chalked<br
/>
Where lines had been defaced and balked,</p>
<p class="poetry">And the work swelled and mounted higher,<br />
Achievement distancing desire;</p>
<p class="poetry">Here jambs with transoms fixed between,<br />
Where never the like before had been&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
215</span>There little mullions thinly sawn<br />
Where meeting circles once were drawn.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;We knew,&rdquo; men said, &ldquo;the
thing would go<br />
After his craft-wit got aglow,</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;And, once fulfilled what he has
designed,<br />
We&rsquo;ll honour him and his great mind!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">When matters stood thus poised awhile,<br />
And all surroundings shed a smile,</p>
<p class="poetry">The master-mason on an eve<br />
Homed to his wife and seemed to grieve . . .</p>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;&ldquo;The abbot spoke to me to-day:<br
/>
He hangs about the works alway.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;He knows the source as well as I<br />
Of the new style men magnify.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;He said: &lsquo;You pride yourself too
much<br />
On your creation.&nbsp; Is it such?</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;&lsquo;Surely the hand of God it is<br
/>
That conjured so, and only His!&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;&lsquo;Disclosing by the frost and
rain<br />
Forms your invention chased in vain;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
216</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hence the devices deemed so great<br />
You copied, and did not create.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;I feel the abbot&rsquo;s words are
just,<br />
And that all thanks renounce I must.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Can a man welcome praise and pelf<br />
For hatching art that hatched itself? . . .</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;So, I shall own the deft design<br />
Is Heaven&rsquo;s outshaping, and not mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;What!&rdquo; said she.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Praise your works ensure<br />
To throw away, and quite obscure</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Your beaming and beneficent star?<br />
Better you leave things as they are!</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Why, think awhile.&nbsp; Had not your
zest<br />
In your loved craft curtailed your rest&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Had you not gone there ere the day<br />
The sun had melted all away!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;But, though his good wife argued so,<br
/>
The mason let the people know</p>
<p class="poetry">That not unaided sprang the thought<br />
Whereby the glorious fane was wrought,</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
217</span>But that by frost when dawn was dim<br />
The method was disclosed to him.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Yet,&rdquo; said the townspeople
thereat,<br />
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis your own doing, even with that!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">But he&mdash;chafed, childlike, in
extremes&mdash;<br />
The temperament of men of dreams&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">Aloofly scrupled to admit<br />
That he did aught but borrow it,</p>
<p class="poetry">And diffidently made request<br />
That with the abbot all should rest.</p>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;As none could doubt the abbot&rsquo;s
word,<br />
Or question what the church averred,</p>
<p class="poetry">The mason was at length believed<br />
Of no more count than he conceived,</p>
<p class="poetry">And soon began to lose the fame<br />
That late had gathered round his name . . .</p>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;Time passed, and like a living thing<br
/>
The pile went on embodying,</p>
<p class="poetry">And workmen died, and young ones grew,<br />
And the old mason sank from view</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
218</span>And Abbots Wygmore and Staunton went<br />
And Horton sped the embellishment.</p>
<p class="poetry">But not till years had far progressed<br />
Chanced it that, one day, much impressed,</p>
<p class="poetry">Standing within the well-graced aisle,<br />
He asked who first conceived the style;</p>
<p class="poetry">And some decrepit sage detailed<br />
How, when invention nought availed,</p>
<p class="poetry">The cloud-cast waters in their whim<br />
Came down, and gave the hint to him</p>
<p class="poetry">Who struck each arc, and made each mould;<br />
And how the abbot would not hold</p>
<p class="poetry">As sole begetter him who applied<br />
Forms the Almighty sent as guide;</p>
<p class="poetry">And how the master lost renown,<br />
And wore in death no artist&rsquo;s crown.</p>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;Then Horton, who in inner thought<br />
Had more perceptions than he taught,</p>
<p class="poetry">Replied: &ldquo;Nay; art can but transmute;<br
/>
Invention is not absolute;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
219</span>&ldquo;Things fail to spring from nought at call,<br />
And art-beginnings most of all.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;He did but what all artists do,<br />
Wait upon Nature for his cue.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;&ldquo;Had you been here to tell them
so<br />
Lord Abbot, sixty years ago,</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;The mason, now long underground,<br />
Doubtless a different fate had found.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;He passed into oblivion dim,<br />
And none knew what became of him!</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;His name?&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas of some
common kind<br />
And now has faded out of mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">The Abbot: &ldquo;It shall not be hid!<br />
I&rsquo;ll trace it.&rdquo; . . . But he never did.</p>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;When longer yet dank death had wormed<br
/>
The brain wherein the style had germed</p>
<p class="poetry">From Gloucester church it flew afar&mdash;<br
/>
The style called Perpendicular.&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">To Winton and to Westminster<br />
It ranged, and grew still beautifuller:</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
220</span>From Solway Frith to Dover Strand<br />
Its fascinations starred the land,</p>
<p class="poetry">Not only on cathedral walls<br />
But upon courts and castle halls,</p>
<p class="poetry">Till every edifice in the isle<br />
Was patterned to no other style,</p>
<p class="poetry">And till, long having played its part,<br />
The curtain fell on Gothic art.</p>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;Well: when in Wessex on your rounds,<br
/>
Take a brief step beyond its bounds,</p>
<p class="poetry">And enter Gloucester: seek the quoin<br />
Where choir and transept interjoin,</p>
<p class="poetry">And, gazing at the forms there flung<br />
Against the sky by one unsung&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">The ogee arches transom-topped,<br />
The tracery-stalks by spandrels stopped,</p>
<p class="poetry">Petrified lacework&mdash;lightly lined<br />
On ancient massiveness behind&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">Muse that some minds so modest be<br />
As to renounce fame&rsquo;s fairest fee,</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
221</span>(Like him who crystallized on this spot<br />
His visionings, but lies forgot,</p>
<p class="poetry">And many a mediaeval one<br />
Whose symmetries salute the sun)</p>
<p class="poetry">While others boom a baseless claim,<br />
And upon nothing rear a name.</p>

<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">Yes</span>; your up-dated
modern page&mdash;<br />
All flower-fresh, as it appears&mdash;<br />
Can claim a time-tried lineage,</p>
<p class="poetry">That reaches backward fifty years<br />
(Which, if but short for sleepy squires,<br />
Is much in magazines&rsquo; careers).</p>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;Here, on your cover, never tires<br />
The sower, reaper, thresher, while<br />
As through the seasons of our sires</p>
<p class="poetry">Each wills to work in ancient style<br />
With seedlip, sickle, share and flail,<br />
Though modes have since moved many a mile!</p>
<p class="poetry">The steel-roped plough now rips the vale,<br />
With cog and tooth the sheaves are won,<br />
Wired wheels drum out the wheat like hail;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
223</span>But if we ask, what has been done<br />
To unify the mortal lot<br />
Since your bright leaves first saw the sun,</p>
<p class="poetry">Beyond mechanic furtherance&mdash;what<br />
Advance can rightness, candour, claim?<br />
Truth bends abashed, and answers not.</p>
<p class="poetry">Despite your volumes&rsquo; gentle aim<br />
To straighten visions wry and wrong,<br />
Events jar onward much the same!</p>
<p class="poetry">&mdash;Had custom tended to prolong,<br />
As on your golden page engrained,<br />
Old processes of blade and prong,</p>
<p class="poetry">And best invention been retained<br />
For high crusades to lessen tears<br />
Throughout the race, the world had gained! . . .<br />
But too much, this, for fifty years.</p>

SATIN SHOES</h3>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">If</span> ever I
walk to church to wed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As other maidens use,<br />
And face the gathered eyes,&rdquo; she said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go in satin shoes!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">She was as fair as early day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shining on meads unmown,<br />
And her sweet syllables seemed to play<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like flute-notes softly blown.</p>
<p class="poetry">The time arrived when it was meet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That she should be a bride;<br />
The satin shoes were on her feet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her father was at her side.</p>
<p class="poetry">They stood within the dairy door,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And gazed across the green;<br />
The church loomed on the distant moor,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But rain was thick between.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
225</span>&ldquo;The grass-path hardly can be stepped,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The lane is like a pool!&rdquo;&mdash;<br />
Her dream is shown to be inept,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her wish they overrule.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;To go forth shod in satin soft<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A coach would be required!&rdquo;<br />
For thickest boots the shoes were doffed&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Those shoes her soul desired . . .</p>
<p class="poetry">All day the bride, as overborne,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was seen to brood apart,<br />
And that the shoes had not been worn<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sat heavy on her heart.</p>
<p class="poetry">From her wrecked dream, as months flew on,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her thought seemed not to range.<br />
&ldquo;What ails the wife?&rdquo; they said anon,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;That she should be so strange?&rdquo; . .
.</p>
<p class="poetry">Ah&mdash;what coach comes with furtive
glide&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A coach of closed-up kind?<br />
It comes to fetch the last year&rsquo;s bride,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who wanders in her mind.</p>
<p class="poetry">She strove with them, and fearfully ran<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Stairward with one low scream:<br />
&ldquo;Nay&mdash;coax her,&rdquo; said the madhouse man,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;With some old household theme.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span>&ldquo;If you will go, dear, you must fain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Put on those shoes&mdash;the pair<br />
Meant for your marriage, which the rain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Forbade you then to wear.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">She clapped her hands, flushed joyous hues;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;O yes&mdash;I&rsquo;ll up and ride<br />
If I am to wear my satin shoes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And be a proper bride!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">Out then her little foot held she,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As to depart with speed;<br />
The madhouse man smiled pleasantly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To see the wile succeed.</p>
<p class="poetry">She turned to him when all was done,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And gave him her thin hand,<br />
Exclaiming like an enraptured one,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;This time it will be grand!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">She mounted with a face elate,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shut was the carriage door;<br />
They drove her to the madhouse gate,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And she was seen no more . . .</p>
<p class="poetry">Yet she was fair as early day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shining on meads unmown,<br />
And her sweet syllables seemed to play<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like flute-notes softly blown.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Making a lusty showing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Each now past all knowing.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">II</p>

In the street and the littered spaces;<br />
Thoroughfare, steeple, bridge and highway<br />

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
